# Testing Guide - Credit Jambo Frontend (Mock Data)

## Mock Data Features

### Pre-loaded Transactions

The app comes with 5 sample transactions:
1. Initial deposit: 50,000 RWF (7 days ago)
2. Monthly savings: 25,000 RWF (5 days ago)
3. Emergency withdrawal: -15,000 RWF (3 days ago)
4. Bonus savings: 30,000 RWF (2 days ago)
5. Personal expense: -10,000 RWF (1 day ago)

**Starting Balance**: 80,000 RWF

### Data Persistence

Mock data is stored in:
- **LocalStorage**: User info, auth tokens
- **Memory**: Transactions (reset on page refresh)

**Note**: Refreshing the page will reset transactions to the original 5, but your auth session will persist.

## Network Delay

All mock services include artificial delays (300-800ms) to simulate real API calls. You'll see:
- Loading spinners
- Disabled buttons during operations
- Smooth state transitions

---

## Mock vs Real API

### Currently Using Mock Services:
- `services/mock/authService.mock.ts`
- `services/mock/accountService.mock.ts`
- `services/mock/transactionService.mock.ts`

### Real API Services (Ready for Backend):
- `services/api/authService.ts`
- `services/api/accountService.ts`
- `services/api/transactionService.ts`

**To switch to real backend**, simply update the imports in:
- `store/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- `store/contexts/AccountContext.tsx`
- `components/transactions/DepositModal.tsx`
- `components/transactions/WithdrawModal.tsx`
- `components/transactions/TransactionHistory.tsx`

Change from:
```typescript
import { ... } from '../../services/mock/...';
```

To:
```typescript
import { ... } from '../../services/api/...';
```

## Troubleshooting

- Check browser console for errors

### Balance Not Updating
- Check browser console for errors
- Try refreshing the page
- Check if localStorage has data

### Transactions Not Showing
